# Hydroelectric-Power-Plant-Automation
A simulation project carried out in Siemens Step 7 and WinCC. 

## Poject Description:
The objective here is to program a control system for a hypothetical hydroelectric power plant. A base program has been provided to simulate a changing environment and it gives analog and digital input signals accordingly. My task was to write a program that incorporates these signals and control various analog and digital devices in order to run the system in a safe and stable manner. Additionally, I created an HMI that will allow a control operator to easily and effectively interact with the control system.

## Theory of Operation
