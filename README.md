# Hydroelectric-Power-Plant-Automation
A simulation project carried out in Siemens Step 7 and WinCC. 

A simulation project carried out in Siemens Step 7 and WinCC. PLC programming and HMI development was done to automate a Hydroelectric Power Plant. Functions of the program:

• Set up the Analog and Digital I/O's, Alarms and HOAs (or Local-Off-Remote control options)
• Defined different operational modes of the Power Plant and called them in a sequence
• PID control of the gates of the intake house and the oil pump VFD
• Developed a HMI/SCADA to monitor and control the entire plant operation

PLC programming languages used were Structured Text (or SCL) and Functional Block Diagram (FBD). A complete description of the project and work done in Siemens TIA is available in my GitHub account.
